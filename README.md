Fork of i3lock-color to hide the greeter text during password verification. This is intended for personal usage.

Changes:
- Hides `--greeter-text` during password verification
- Positions `--noinput-text` at the location specified by `--wrong-pos`, since it derives other properties from the `--wrong-{property}` family of arguments anyway.
